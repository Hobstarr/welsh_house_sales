## Welsh House Sales: 
I wondered if house sales were unexpectedly low this year, so quickly looked through the last ~20 years of houses sales for comparison.

This analysis was derived using National statistics from: [HR Revenue + Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-property-transactions-completed-in-the-uk-with-value-40000-or-above)

### setting up environment: 
Setting up environment, this was built using python 3.12.1 and pip 23.3.2. 

After cloning the repository, build a virtual environment:

``` python venv .venv ```

Activate .venv and install requirements:

``` pip install -r requiements.txt ```
